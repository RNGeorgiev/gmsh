# GMSH geometries for active matter research
Functions utilizing the GMSH Python API to generate models and meshes
of asymmetric particles used in quasi-2D and active matter studies.

## Common (common.py)
Common functions used by the other modules.

## Tools (tools.py)
Functions for mesh reading, writing, and re-ordering by proximity.

## Three-dimensional bodies (d3.py)
High-level functions to generate dimers and trimers comprising spheres
and cylinders.

## Quasi-two-dimensional bodies (q2d.py)
High-level functions to generate quasi-2D dimers and trimers comprising
disks and rods with rounded edges.

## Corrugated walls (wavywall.py)
High-level functions to generate an corrugated wall, whose flat parts
have a normal (1, 0, 0).

## Helical swimmer (helix.py)
High-level functions to generate an active helix starting and ending
with spherical caps.

## Spiral spheroid (spiral.py)
