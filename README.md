# GMSH geometries for active matter research
A collection of functions utilizing the GMSH Python API to generate
models and meshes of asymmetric particles used in quasi-2D flow and
active matter studies.

## Common (common.py)
Common functions used by the other modules.

## Tools (tools.py)
To-do 2

## Three-dimensional bodies (d3.py)
High-level functions to generate dimers and trimers comprising
spheres and cylinders.

## Quasi-two-dimensional bodies (q2d.py)
High-level functions to generate quasi-2D dimers and trimers comprising
disks and rods with rounded edges.

## Corrugated walls (wavywall.py)

## Helical swimmer (helix.py)

## Spiral spheroid (spiral.py)
