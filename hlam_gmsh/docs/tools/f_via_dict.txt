    For a set of physical groups with names `gEs.keys()`, sets
    the activity (or mobility) of the elements in a given group
    to the value in `f` with the same key. Elements in groups, whose
    name is not in `f.keys()`, have activities (or mobilities) of zero.
    By default, the activity (or mobility) at a node is the average
    activity (or mobility) at the elements containing the node. This
    value can be rounded up (with numpy.ceil) or rouned down (with
    numpy.floor) if `f` contains a {'method': numpy.ufunc} pair.

    Parameters
    ----------
    f : dict
        Activity (or mobility) per physical group of elements.
    ps : P-by-3 numpy array
        XYZ-coordinates of nodes.
    es : E-by-6 numpy array
        Node indices per element.
    gEs : dict
        Contains pairs of physical group names and arrays of element
        indices falling into the respective physical group.

    Returns
    -------
    P-by-1 numpy array, E-by-1 numpy array
        Activities (or mobilities) at the nodes and at the elements.
