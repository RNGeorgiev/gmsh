    Sets the activities (or mobilities) of all nodes and elements
    to `f`.

    Parameters
    ----------
    f : int or float
        Activity (or mobility) of all nodes and elements.
    ps : P-by-3 numpy array
        XYZ-coordinates of nodes.
    es : E-by-6 numpy array
        Node indices per element.
    gEs : dict
        Contains pairs of physical group names and arrays of element
        indices falling into the respective physical group.

    Returns
    -------
    P-by-1 numpy array, E-by-1 numpy array
        Activities (or mobilities) at the nodes and at the elements.
