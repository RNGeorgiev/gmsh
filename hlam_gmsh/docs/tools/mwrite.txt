    Exports an array of nodes `ps` and an array of second-order
    triangles `es` as a GMSH 2.2 *.msh file to path `fileName`.
    If a dictionary `gs` is passed, the elements are partitioned
    into physical groups. The dictionary `gs` must contain the names of
    physical groups as keys and arrays with element indices as values.
    The number of nodes is P and the number of elements is E.

    Parameters
    ----------
    fileName : str
        Path to which the GMSH 2.2 *.msh file is written.
    ps : P-by-3 numpy array
        XYZ-coordinates of nodes.
    es : E-by-6 numpy array
        Node indices per element.
    gs : dict, default=None
        Contains pairs of physical group names and arrays of element
        indices falling into the respective physical group.

    Returns
    -------
    None
