    Evaluates `f` and sets the nodal activities (or mobilities)
    according to the function in `f`. The string `f` may contain
    'xs', 'ys', and 'zs', which denote the x-, y-, and z-coordinates
    of the nodes. The activity (or mobility) at each element is the
    mean activity (or mobility) of its nodes.

    Example:
        '[1 if x > 0 else 0 for x in xs]' -- sets the activity
        (or mobility) of all nodes with positive x-coodinates
        to unity. All other acitivites (or mobilities) are set
        to zero.

    Parameters
    ----------
    f : str
        String with function to be evaluated.
    ps : P-by-3 numpy array
        XYZ-coordinates of nodes.
    es : E-by-6 numpy array
        Node indices per element.
    gEs : dict
        Contains pairs of physical group names and arrays of element
        indices falling into the respective physical group.

    Returns
    -------
    P-by-1 numpy array, E-by-1 numpy array
        Activities (or mobilities) at the nodes and at the elements.
