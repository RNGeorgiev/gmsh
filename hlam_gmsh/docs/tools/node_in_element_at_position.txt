    Generates a connectivity table in the form of a numpy array.
    Each row corresponds to a node number (e.g. 0th row -> 0th node,
    1st row -> 1st node, etc.). The first column of the connectivity
    table contains the number of elements a node is part of. The
    following columns contain the element number and position within
    the element in an alternating fashion. Partially filled rows are
    padded with negative unity.

    Parameters
    ----------
    es : N-by-6 numpy array
        Each row contains the six nodes each element comprises.

    Returns
    -------
    numpy array
        Connectivity table with occurances, element indices and
        element positons.
