    Determines how the activities or the mobilities are computed
    depending on the type of `rule`:
        1) Integers and floats trigger mesh.f_via_float
        2) Dictionaries trigger mesh.f_via_dict
        3) Strings trigger mesh.f_via_str
    The arguments of the current function are passed to the triggered
    mesh.f_via_*. The number of nodes in `ps` is P and the number
    of elements in `es` is E.

    Parameters
    ----------
    rule : int, float, dict or str
        Activity (or mobility) at the nodes and/or elements.
    ps : P-by-3 numpy array
        XYZ-coordinates of nodes.
    es : E-by-6 numpy array
        Node indices per element.
    gEs : dict
        Contains pairs of physical group names and arrays of element
        indices falling into the respective physical group.

    Returns
    -------
    P-by-1 numpy array, E-by-1 numpy array
        Activities (or mobilities) at the nodes and at the elements.

    Raises
    ------
    Exception
        If rule is not an int, a float, a string, or a dict.
