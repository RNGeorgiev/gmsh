	Generates a dimer comprising a large sphere of radius `k` * `rS`
    and a small sphere of radius `rS` connected via a cylinder of
    length `cyl`[0] and radius `cyl`[1]. The large sphere is centered
    at (0, 0, 0). The cylinder's axis is parallel to the x-axis.
    Optionally, meshes the model, writes the mesh, and visualizes is.

    Parameters
    ----------
    k : float
        Ratio of the two sphere radii.
    rS : float, default=0.56
        Radius of the smaller sphere.
    cyl: list, default=[1.85, 0.20]
        [Length, Radius] of the connecting cylinder.
    gs : bool, default=True
        Determines if the surfaces of the dimer should be placed in a
        physical group 'Surface'. For details, see common.unify_surfs
    ls : float or list, default=0
        If `ls` is a float it sets the maximum mesh size. If `ls` is
        a list, containing a float and a string, sets the maximum
        element size to the float and exports a GMSH 2.2 *.msh file
        using string as name.
    viz : bool, default=False
        A flag controlling visualisation.

    Returns
    -------
    dimer : int
        Volume tag of the dimer.
