    Generates a model of a trimer (L--M--U) comprising a sphere M
    of radius `k` * `rS`, centered at (0, 0, 0), between two other
    spheres. The angle the three spheres form (LMU) is `f`. Sphere U
    has radius `rS` and sphere L has radius `l` * `rS`. Spheres M and U
    are connected via a cylinder MU with length `cylUL`[0][0] and
    radius `cylUL`[0][1]. Spheres M and L are connected via a cylinder
    ML with length `cylUL`[1][0] and radius `cylUL`[1][1]
    Optionally, meshes the model, writes the mesh, and visualizes is.

    Parameters
    ----------
    k : float
        Ratio of sphere M's radius to sphere U's radius.
    f : float
        Angle formed by the three spheres (L-M-U) in degrees.
    l : float
        Ratio of sphere L's radius to sphere U's radius.
    rS : float, default=0.56
        Radius of sphere U.
    cylUL : list, default=[[1.85, 0.20], [1.85, 0.20]]
        [[Length, Radius] of cylinder MU,
        [Length, Radius] of cylinder LU].
    gs : bool, default=True
        Determines if the surfaces of the trimer should be placed in a
        physical group 'Surface'. For details, see common.unify_surfs
    ls : float or list, default=0
        If `ls` is a float it sets the maximum mesh size. If `ls` is
        a list, containing a float and a string, sets the maximum
        element size to the float and exports a GMSH 2.2 *.msh file
        using string as name.
    viz : bool, default=False
        A flag controlling visualisation.

    Returns
    -------
    trimer : int
        Volume tag of the trimer.
