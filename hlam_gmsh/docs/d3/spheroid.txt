    Generates a model of a (0, 0, 0)-centered spheroid with one
    semiaxis r in the xy-plane and another semi-axis c*r, normal to it.
    Optionally, meshes the model, writes the mesh, and visualizes is.

    Parameters
    ----------
    r : float
        Semi-axis in the xy-plane.
    c : float
        Ratio between the two semi-axes.
    partOf: model, default=None
        Determines if the spheroid is part of a complex shape.
        For details, see common.is_part_of()
    ls : float or list, default=0
        If `ls` is a float it sets the maximum mesh size. If `ls` is
        a list, containing a float and a string, sets the maximum
        element size to the float and exports a GMSH 2.2 *.msh file
        using string as name.
    viz : bool, default=False
        A flag controlling visualisation.

    Returns
    -------
    spheroid : int
        Volume tag of the spheroid.
