    Generates a model of a wall of width w (along the y-axis) with
    corrugations centered at (0, 0, 0). The corrugation shape is set
    via `waveform`, its amplitude is `A`, the number of periods is `N`
    and its wavelength is `l`. The corrugation tilt, relative to the
    y-axis, is `q` degrees. The heights (along the z-axis) of the flat
    regions above and below the corrugations are set by `above` and
    `below`. The maximum mesh size in the flat regions is given by `ls`
    (or `ls`[0] if the mesh is to be exported). The maximum mesh size
    in the corrugated region is `ratio` times smaller than in the flat
    part.
    Optionally, meshes the model, writes the mesh, and visualizes is.

    Parameters
    ----------
    waveform : str
        One of four available shapes:
        sine, sawtooth, triangle, or square.
    w : float
        Plate width.
    A : float
        Corrugation amplitude.
    N : int
        Number of periods.
    l : float
        Wavelength.
    q : float
        Tilt angle of the corrugation in degrees.
    ls : float or list, default=0
        If `ls` is a float it sets the maximum mesh size in the flat
        region. If `ls` is a list, containing a float and a string,
        sets the maximum element size in the flat region to the float
        and exports a GMSH 2.2 *.msh file using string as name.
    ratio : float
        Refinement factor for the corrugated region.
    viz : bool, default=True
        A flag controlling visualisation.

    Returns
    -------
    None
