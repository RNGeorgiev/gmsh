    Generates a q2D trimer (L--M--U) comprising a cylinder M of
    radius `k` * `rS`, centered at (0, 0, 0), between two other
    cylinders. The angle `f` formed by the three cylinders (LMU) is
    given in degrees. Cylinder U has radius `rS` and cylinder L has
    radius `l` * `rS`. Cylinders M and U are connected via a rod MU
    with length `rodUL`[0][0] and width `rod UL`[0][1]. Cylinders M
    and L are connected via a rod ML with length `rodUL`[1][0] and
    radius `rodUL`[1][1]. All five bodies have a thickness `H`. The
    edges of the cylinders and the rods can be rounded off with a
    fillet radius of `rZ`.
    Optionally, meshes the model, writes the mesh, and visualizes is.

    Parameters
    ----------
    k : float
        Ratio of cylinder M's radius to cylinder U's radius.
    f : float
        Angle between the three cylinders (L-M-U) in degrees.
    H : float
        Particle thickness.
    l : float
        Ratio of cylinder L's radius to cylinder U's radius.
    rZ : float, default=0.1
        Rounding radius for all edges normal to the z-axis.
    rS : float, default=0.56
        Radius of cylinder U.
    rodUL : list, default=[[1.85, 0.41], [1.85, 0.41]]
        [[Length, Width] of rod MU, [Length, Width] of cylinder ML].
    gs : bool, default=True
        A flag, which assigns physical groups to the:
            1) bases (surfaces normal to the z-axis)
            2) sides (surfaces normal to the xy-plane)
            3) edges (surfaces which are neither bases, nor sides)
    ls : float or list, default=0
        If `ls` is a float it sets the maximum mesh size. If `ls` is
        a list, containing a float and a string, sets the maximum
        element size to the float and exports a GMSH 2.2 *.msh file
        using string as name.
    viz : bool, default=False
        A flag controlling visualisation.

    Returns
    -------
    timer : int
        Volume tag of the trimer.
