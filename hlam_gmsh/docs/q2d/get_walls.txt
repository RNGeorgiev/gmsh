    Computes the normal of each surface and places each in one of
    five groups, depending on the z-component NVz of said normal:
        1) top walls (NVz = 1)
        2) bottom walls (NVz = -1)
        3) side walls (NVz = 0)
        4) top edges (1 > NVz > 0)
        5) bottom edges (-1 < NVz < 0)

    Parameters
    ----------
    model : class
        Model, containing the body.
    vol : int, tuple, or dimTag
        Volume tag of the body, whose surfaces are to be clasified.

    Returns
    -------
    surfs : list
        Contains the dimTags of the surfaces in the top base,
        the bottom walls, the side walls, the top edge, and
        the bottom edge.
