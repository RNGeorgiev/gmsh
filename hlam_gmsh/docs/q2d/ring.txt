    Generates a model of a ring centered at (0, 0, 0) with an outer
    radius `R`, inner radius `r` and thickness `H`. The edges of the
    ring can be rounded off with a fillet radius of rZ. The ring
    becomes a torus if the rounding radius is too large. The ring can
    be a part of a complex body by supplying a model class as `partOf`.
    Optionally, meshes the ring, writes the mesh, and visualizes is.

    Parameters
    ----------
    R : float
        Outer radius.
    r : float
        Inner radius.
    H : float
        Particle thickness.
    rZ : float, default=0.1
        Rounding radius for all edges on surfaces normal to the z-axis.
    partOf: class, default=None
        Determines if the ring is part of a complex shape.
        For details, see common.is_part_of()
    gs : bool, default=False
        A flag, which assigns physical groups to the:
            1) bases (surfaces normal to the z-axis)
            2) sides (surfaces normal to the xy-plane)
            3) edges (surfaces which are neither bases, nor sides)
    ls : float or list, default=0
        If `ls` is a float it sets the maximum mesh size.
        If `ls` is a list, containing a float and a string, sets the
        maximum element size to the float and exports a GMSH 2.2 *.msh
        file using the string as name. The default export behaviour to
        *.msh file can be overridden by explicitly including the
        extension in the string. For example `ls`=[0.1, 'particle.stp']
        exports a STEP file.
    viz : bool, default=False
        A flag controlling visualisation.

    Returns
    -------
    ring : int
        Volume tag of the ring.
