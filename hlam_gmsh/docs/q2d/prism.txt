    Generates a model of a prism centered at (0, 0, 0) and inscribed
    in a circle or radius `R`. The prism base is an isosceles triangle
    with angle `a` in degrees between the equal sides. All edges of the
    prism can be rounded off. Edges, normal to the xy-plane, are
    filleted with a radius `rXY` and edges, parallel to it, are
    filleted with a radius `rZ`. The in-plane rounding does not change
    the radius of the escribing circle. The height of the prism is `H`.
    The prism can be a part of a complex body by supplying a model
    class as `partOf`.
    Optionally, meshes the prism, writes the mesh, and visualizes is.

    Parameters
    ----------
    R : float
        Radius of the escribing circle.
    a : float
        Angle between the two equal sides in degrees.
    H : float
        Particle thickness.
    rZ : float, default=0
        Rounding radius for all edges normal to the z-axis.
    rXY : float, default=0
        Rounding radius for all edges normal to the xy-plane.
    partOf: class, default=None
        Determines if the prism is part of a complex shape.
        For details, see common.is_part_of().
    gs : bool, default=False
        A flag, which assigns physical groups to the:
            1) bases (surfaces normal to the z-axis)
            2) sides (surfaces normal to the xy-plane)
            3) edges (surfaces which are neither bases, nor sides)
    ls : float or list, default=0
        If ls is a float it sets the maximum mesh size. If ls is
        a list, containing a float and a string, sets the maximum
        element size to the float and exports a GMSH 2.2 *.msh file
        using string as name.
    viz : bool, default=False
        A flag controlling visualisation.

    Returns
    -------
    prism : int
        Volume tag of the prism.
