    Generates a q2D dimer comprising a large cylinder of radius
    `k` * `rS` and a small cylinder of radius `rS` connected via a rod
    of length `rd`[0] and width `rd`[1]. All three bodies have a
    thickness `H`. The large cylinder is centered at (0, 0, 0). The
    long axis of the rod is parallel to the x-axis. The edges of the
    cylinders and the rod can be rounded off with a fillet radius of
    `rZ`.
    Optionally, meshes the dimer, writes the mesh, and visualizes is.

    Parameters
    ----------
    k : float
        Ratio of the two cylinder radii.
    H : float
        Particle thickness.
    rZ : float, default=0.1
        Rounding radius for all edges normal to the z-axis.
    rS : float, default=0.56
        Radius of the smaller cylinder.
    rd: list, default=[1.85, 0.41]
        [Length, Width] of the connecting rod.
    gs : bool, default=True
        A flag, which assigns physical groups to the:
            1) bases (surfaces normal to the z-axis)
            2) sides (surfaces normal to the xy-plane)
            3) edges (surfaces which are neither bases, nor sides)
    ls : float or list, default=0
        If `ls` is a float it sets the maximum mesh size.
        If `ls` is a list, containing a float and a string, sets the
        maximum element size to the float and exports a GMSH 2.2 *.msh
        file using the string as name. The default export behaviour to
        *.msh file can be overridden by explicitly including the
        extension in the string. For example `ls`=[0.1, 'particle.stp']
        exports a STEP file.
    viz : bool, default=False
        A flag controlling visualisation.

    Returns
    -------
    dimer : int
        Volume tag of the dimer.
