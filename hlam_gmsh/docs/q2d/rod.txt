    Generates a model of a rod of lenght `l` (along the x-axis) and
    width `w` (along the y-axis). The rod is centered at (0, 0, 0)
    and its thickness is `H`. All edges of the rod can be rounded off.
    Edges, normal to the xy-plane, are filleted with a radius `rXY` and
    edges, parallel to it, are filleted with a radius `rZ`. The rod can
    be a part of a complex body by supplying a model class as `partOf`.
    Optionally, meshes the rod, writes the mesh, and visualizes is.

    Parameters
    ----------
    l : float
        Rod length.
    w : float
        Rod width.
    H : float
        Particle thickness.
    rZ : float, default=0.1
        Rounding radius for all edges normal to the the z-axis.
    rXY : float, default=0.1
        Rounding radius for all edges normal to the xy-plane.
    partOf: class, default=None
        Determines if the rod is part of a complex shape.
        For details, see common.is_part_of()
    gs : bool, default=False
        A flag, which assigns physical groups to the:
            1) bases (surfaces normal to the z-axis)
            2) sides (surfaces normal to the xy-plane)
            3) edges (surfaces which are neither bases, nor sides)
    ls : float or list, default=0
        If ls is a float it sets the maximum mesh size. If ls is
        a list, containing a float and a string, sets the maximum
        element size to the float and exports a GMSH 2.2 *.msh file
        using string as name.
    viz : bool, default=False
        A flag controlling visualisation.

    Returns
    -------
    box : int
        Volume tag of the rod.
