    Checks if the supplied mesh (either file path or gmsh.model.mesh
    class) is watertight by making sure every edge is included in two
    faces (see the trimesh documentation for more information).

    Parameters
    ----------
    mesh : str or class
        Mesh object. If `mesh` is a string, builds a new geometry and
        loads a file into GMSH using `mesh` as file path. Otherwise,
        expects `mesh` to be a gmsh.model.mesh class
    viz : bool, default=False
        Visualizes the mesh with pyglet. If the supplied mesh is not
        watertight overwrites `viz` and displays the mesh with holes
        colored in red.

    Returns
    -------
    None
