    Evaluates the quality of all elements in the supplied mesh (either
    a filepath  or a gmsh.model.mesh class) using two metrics, minSICN
    and gamma, builds histograms for each one, and prints basic quality
    statistics such as mean, st. deviation, and worst.

    Parameters
    ----------
    mesh : str or class
        Mesh object. If `mesh` is a string, builds a new geometry and
        loads a file into GMSH using `mesh` as file path. Otherwise,
        expects `mesh` to be a gmsh.model.mesh class.

    Returns
    -------
    None
