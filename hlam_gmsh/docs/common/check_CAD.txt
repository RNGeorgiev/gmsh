    Determines the CAD kernel (OpenCASCADE or built-in) being used
    via the number of entities in both. As only one or the other is
    usually used, only one of the two contains entities. If both
    kernals are empty, the function returns the OpenCASCADE kernel.

    Parameters
    ----------
    model : class
        Model, in which the CAD kernel is determined.

    Returns
    -------
    geo : class
        The active CAD kernel.
