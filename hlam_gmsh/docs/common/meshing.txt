    Meshes the current model, checks if the mesh is watertight, outputs
    a 3D model with bad faces (if any), and prints quality of element
    statistics such as mean, st. deviation, worst, and a histogram.

    Parameters
    ----------
    model : class
        Model to be meshed.
    ls : float or list
        If `ls` is a float it sets the maximum mesh size.
        If `ls` is a list, containing a float and a string, sets the
        maximum element size to the float and exports a GMSH 2.2 *.msh
        file using the string as name. The default export behaviour to
        *.msh file can be overridden by explicitly including the
        extension in the string. For example `ls`=[0.1, 'particle.stp']
        exports a STEP file.
    vol : int, tuple, or dimTag, default=-1
        Body for which the normals of each element are set to
        point outward.

    Returns
    -------
    None
