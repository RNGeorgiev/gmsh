    Meshes the current model, checks if the mesh is watertight, outputs
    a 3D model with bad faces (if any), and prints quality of element
    statistics such as mean, st. deviation, worst, and a histogram.

    Parameters
    ----------
    model : class
        Model to be meshed.
    ls : float or list
        If `ls` is a float it sets the maximum mesh size.
        If `ls` is a list, containing a float and a string, sets the
        maximum element size to the float and exports a GMSH 2.2 *.msh
        file using string as name.
    vol : int, tuple, or dimTag, default=-1
        Body for which the normals of each element are set to
        point outward.
