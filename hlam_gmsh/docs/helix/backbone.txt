    Initializes the model, geometry, and opts classes. Also,
    generates P number of points along a helical path, which are later
    used to construct Spline curves for extrusion.

    Parameters
    ----------
    turns : list or int
        Determines how many periods are made before the activity
        switches.
    R : float
        Distance from the helix centerline to the center of the tube.
    l : float
        Helical pitch.

    Returns
    -------
    model : class
        Model class of the helix.
    xyz : P-by-3 numpy array
        Coordinates of the guide points.
    ps : list
        Point tags of the guide points.
    ranges : list
        The tags of the start and end point for each helical chunk.
