    Generates a chunk of the helix. Assumes the activity does not
    switch across different chunks, i.e. an active surface is extruded
    to produce an active volume. This is corrected (if necessary) once
    all chunks and the end cap are generated.

    Parameters
    ----------
    model : class
        Model class of the helix.
    ps : list
        Tags of the guide points.
    r : float
        Helical tube radius.
    rng : tuple
        A range of point tags along which the active  and passive
        surfaces are extruded.
    spring : list
        Contains lists of dimTags of the active and passive
        parts of the helix, as output by either start_cap or chunk.

    Returns
    -------
    spring : list
        Contains updated lists of dimTags of the:
        1) active surface to be extruded along the next Spline chunk,
        2) active surfaces,
        3) passive surface to be extruded along the next Spline chunk,
        4) passive surfaces.
