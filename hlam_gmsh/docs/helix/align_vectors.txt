    Computes the rotation angles about the x-, y-, and z- axes
    needed to align v1 to v2. An identity matrix of size 3 is
    concatinated horizontally with the resulting column vector.

    Parameters
    ----------
    v1 : list or numpy array
        Vector to be rotated.
    v2 : list or numpy array
        Vector, with which v1 is to align.

    Returns
    -------
    rotM : 4-by-3 numpy array
        Resulting rotational matrix.
