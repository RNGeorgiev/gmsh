    Generates the ending cap of the helix which adopts the activity of
    the preceding chunk of the helix.

    Parameters
    ----------
    model : class
        Model class of the helix.
    turns : list or int
        Determines how many periods are made before the activity
        switches.
    xyz : numpy array
        Coordinates of the guide points.
   r : float
        Helical tube/cap radius.
    xi : float
        Fraction of the helix/cap which is active.
    q : float
        Orientation of the active strip in degrees.
    spring : list
        Contains lists of dimTags of the active and passive parts of
        the helix, as output by chunk.

    Returns
    -------
    spring : list
        Contains updated lists of dimTags of the:
        1) active surfaces,
        2) passive surfaces.
