    Generates a model of a helix of radius `R` and pitch `l` having an
    active strip. The helix has a tube radius of `r` and comprises
    sum(`turns`) windings. It begins and ends with spherical caps. The
    starting cap is centered at (R, 0, 0). The size of the strip is
    defined via `xi`, which takes values from 0 to 1, where 0 denotes
    an entirely passive starting cap and 1 corresponds to an entirely
    active starting cap. Fractional activities make the cap azimuth
    [-pi * act, pi * act] active, where 0 is parallel to the x-axis.
    The strip's orientation can be controlled via q. If more than one
    value is passed to `turns` the activity switches after `turns`[0]
    periods. The first `turns`[0] periods the helix adopts the same
    activity as the starting cap. The end cap adopts the activity of
    the last portion of the helix.
    Optionally, meshes the model, writes the mesh, and visualizes is.

    Parameters
    ----------
    turns : list
        Number of periods made before the activity switches.
    xi : float
        Fraction of the helix which is active.
    R : float
        Distance from the helix centerline to the center of the tube.
    r : float
        Helical tube radius.
    l : float, default=1
        Helical pitch.
    q : float, default=0
        Orientation of the active strip.
    ls : float or list, default=0
        If `ls` is a float it sets the maximum mesh size.
        If `ls` is a list, containing a float and a string, sets the
        maximum element size to the float and exports a GMSH 2.2 *.msh
        file using the string as name. The default export behaviour to
        *.msh file can be overridden by explicitly including the
        extension in the string. For example `ls`=[0.1, 'particle.stp']
        exports a STEP file.
    viz : bool, default=False
        A flag controlling visualisation.

    Returns
    -------
    helix : list
        Contains lists of dimTags of the active and passive surfaces,
        comprising the helix, as output by assemble_helix.
